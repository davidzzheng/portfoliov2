          competitions. Originally started as an electronics class, the program quickly grew into a

          During my time there, I lead a team to a world championship qualification spot as a

          forward software-oriented solutions that took advantage of the sensors that were available
          to us, and open-sourced our code for our underclassmen to learn from and build upon after
          we graduated.
